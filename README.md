# Sync Secondary Window Screen

A Visual Studio Code extension that helps you view and edit your code more efficiently using a synchronized secondary window. This extension creates a distraction-free view of your current file that automatically updates as you switch between files or make changes.

## Features

- **Synchronized View**: The secondary window automatically updates to show whatever file you're currently editing in your main VS Code window
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes made in either window are instantly reflected in both views
- **Distraction-free Mode**: The secondary window shows only the code content in a clean, zen-like view
- **Theme Support**: Automatically matches your VS Code theme preferences
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Quick access using `Ctrl+Shift+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+S` (Mac)

## Usage

1. Open any file in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+S` (Mac), or:
3. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
4. Type "Open Secondary Sync Window" and select the command

The secondary window will appear and automatically stay in sync with your active file.
